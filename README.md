# StockPricePrediction

I have got a dataset from https://www.quandl.com to implement a Machain Learning to predict a stock price. 

### This repository contains five files:
- *StockPricePrediction.py* is the main file, where all other files are imported to executed.
- I implemented some function to discover a dataset in a file called *DiscoveringDate.py*
- In *PrepareData.py*, I built functions to prepare data for modeling.
- In *MLModeling.py* I created five classes for different five models:
      1. LinearRegressionModel
      2. KNearestNeighboursModel
      3. MARSmodel
      4. RandomforestModel
      5. XGBoostModel
- In *DLModeling.py*, I wanted to start working on this part, however, because of a deadline and have to start working on the Capstone project I delay that until after graduation.
